During high school, I discovered my interest in Economics and when arriving at UVA I realized I had a passion for Computer Science too. I am currently evaluating career paths related to both majors and I am looking to get a wide range of new experiences. This summer I will be a Software Development intern at an Investment/Portfolio Management firm. ",
